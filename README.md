# Brief detail about the dataset:
The dataset we will use for our project consists of 11,430 URLs, equally balanced with 50% phishing and 50% legitimate URLs, making it ideal for binary classification tasks. It includes 87 features extracted from various aspects of the URLs, categorized into three key areas:
1.	Structural and Syntax-Based Features (56 features): These capture characteristics from the URL itself, such as length, special characters, and domain information, to identify patterns commonly associated with phishing attempts.
2.	Content-Based Features (24 features): These are extracted from the content of the web pages, including HTML elements, keywords, and links that help in distinguishing between phishing and legitimate pages.
3.	Service-Based Features (7 features): These are derived from external services (e.g., Whois and IP lookup), offering additional context such as registration data and the URL's reputation in known databases.
This dataset provides a comprehensive view of phishing behavior across different dimensions, making it well-suited for developing machine learning models aimed at detecting phishing attacks. Its balanced nature ensures unbiased training and testing, contributing to reliable and effective phishing detection solutions.

# Objective of this dataset mining:
The objective of this project is to develop a robust machine learning model that effectively detects phishing URLs using a comprehensive dataset of 11,430 URLs, which are evenly split between phishing and legitimate sites. By leveraging 87 extracted features from structural, content-based, and service-based categories, the project aims to improve the accuracy of phishing detection systems. We will explore various machine learning algorithms to identify patterns and characteristics that distinguish phishing attempts from legitimate URLs. Ultimately, the goal is to enhance cybersecurity measures by providing a reliable and efficient tool for identifying and mitigating phishing threats, thereby protecting users and their sensitive information from potential fraud.
# Business problems which can be addressed in this project:
Our project aims to address several critical business challenges that organizations face today:
1. Financial Fraud Prevention: Financial institution clients are frequently the subject of phishing assaults, which result in unlawful transactions and large financial losses. By putting in place a strong detection system, you can assist in stopping these assaults and protecting client assets and the company's image.
2. Brand Reputation Management: Phishing techniques sometimes involve impersonation of companies, which can negatively impact their brand image and undermine customer confidence. Reliable detection systems will reduce this danger and protect the brand's integrity.
3. Boosting Customer Confidence: As phishing attempts get more complex; clients could feel exposed when communicating online. more client confidence and more participation with safe platforms might result from a phishing detection system that is dependable.
4. Regulatory Compliance: Strict cybersecurity laws that safeguard customer information applies to a wide range of sectors. By helping firms comply with these regulations, this effort will lower their chance of facing legal repercussions.
5. Operational Efficiency and Cost Reduction: Security teams can reduce their manual burden by automating the detection and response to phishing threats. This improves efficiency and lowers operational expenses.
6. Better Email Security: The organization's overall security posture will be strengthened by incorporating the phishing detection model into its current email security solutions. This will reduce the possibility of successful phishing attempts and increase resilience against cyber threats.
# Dataset Description:
The dataset contains 87 columns, with information primarily related to URLs and their characteristics, often used to classify them as either "legitimate" or "phishing." Here's an overview of some key columns that we will be using for detection:
1.	url: The actual URL being analyzed.
2.	length_url: Length of the URL.
3.	length_hostname: Length of the hostname part of the URL.
4.	ip: Whether the URL contains an IP address (1) or not (0).
5.	nb_dots: The number of dots in the URL.
6.	nb_hyphens: The number of hyphens in the URL.
7.	nb_at: The number of "@" symbols in the URL.
8.	nb_qm: The number of question marks in the URL.
9.	nb_and: The number of ampersand symbols (&) in the URL.
10.	nb_or: The number of "or" occurrences in the URL.
11.	domain_in_title: Whether the domain appears in the page's title.
12.	domain_with_copyright: Whether the domain name appears with a copyright statement on the page.
13.	whois_registered_domain: Whether WHOIS information is registered for the domain.
14.	domain_registration_length: The length of time the domain has been registered.
15.	domain_age: Age of the domain in days.
16.	web_traffic: The amount of web traffic the site receives.
17.	dns_record: Whether the DNS record exists for the domain.
18.	google_index: Whether the URL is indexed by Google (1) or not (0).
19.	page_rank: PageRank score of the URL.
20.	status: Classification of the URL as "legitimate" or "phishing."
# Preprocessing Steps: 
Handling Missing Values:
Some columns may have missing or null values (e.g., domain_age, web_traffic).
Imputing missing values: For continuous variables like domain_age, we can use mean or median imputation. For categorical variables, use mode or a specific value like "unknown."
Encoding Categorical Variables:
Variables like status (phishing vs. legitimate) need to be converted into numerical values.
•	Label Encoding: Encode status as 1 for phishing and 0 for legitimate.
•	One-hot encoding: If there are other categorical variables (e.g., domain-related information), consider one-hot encoding.
  Feature Selection:
It’s important to reduce the number of irrelevant features, especially if some columns don’t contribute much to phishing detection.
•	Correlation Analysis: You can drop highly correlated or irrelevant features using heatmap.
•	Feature Importance: Use decision trees or random forests to get feature importance scores.
•	PCA: PCA will be used to reduce the large number of features while preserving 95% of the variance. This will help improve model efficiency by focusing on the most critical factors, such as URL length, domain age, and page rank, which are key indicators of phishing behavior.
  Splitting the Data: 
Divide the dataset into training and testing sets (typically 80% training and 20% testing).
# Data Visualization Techniques that will be further used:
To gain an initial understanding of the dataset, the following data visualization techniques will be employed:
•	Histograms: To explore the distribution of numeric features such as URL length, domain registration length, etc.
•	Correlation Heatmap: To analyze the relationships between various features in the dataset.
•	Bar Graphs: To visualize the distribution of phishing vs legitimate websites.
•	Boxplots: To detect outliers and gain insight into the distribution of key numerical variables.
#P rediction Techniques that will be used:
The following machine learning algorithms will be used to build the phishing detection model:
•	Logistic Regression: As a baseline classifier for binary classification.
•	Random Forest Classifier: To leverage the power of decision trees and bagging for more accurate results.
•	Decision Trees: Using decision trees, which learn decision rules based on important criteria like URL length, page rank, and domain registration length, this phishing detection model can identify websites as real or phishing. They are perfect for spotting phishing tendencies because they offer an understandable model that can manage intricate, non-linear interactions in the data.
